# 8 must know DATA STRUCTURES for programmers

## What is Data Structure?

A **data structure** is an organized way to store data on our computer so that it can be used more effectively. We will discuss them briefly.

## Array

An **array** is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements each identified by at least one array index.

## Linked List

A **linked list** is a sequential structure that consists of a sequence of items in linear order which are linked to each other.

## Stack

**Stack** is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out).

## Queue

A **Queue** is a linear structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out(FIFO).

## Hash Table

**Hash table** is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values. A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index, also called hash code, into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.

## Tree

A **Tree** is a widely used abstract data type that simulates a hierarchical tree structure, with a root value and subtrees of children with a parent node, represented as a set of linked nodes.

## Heap

A **Heap** is a special case of a binary tree where the parent nodes are compared to there children with their values and are arranged accordingly.

## Graph

A **Graph** is a nonlinear data structure consisting of nodes and edges. The nodes are sometimes also referred to as vertices and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph.
